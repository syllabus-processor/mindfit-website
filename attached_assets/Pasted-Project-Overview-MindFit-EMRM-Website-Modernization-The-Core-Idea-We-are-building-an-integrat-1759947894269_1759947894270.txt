Project Overview: MindFit EMRM + Website Modernization
🎯 The Core Idea

We are building an integrated digital ecosystem for MindFit Mental Health, a therapy practice specializing in tech-empowered treatment for kids, teens, and families. The project has two primary components:

🧠 1. EMRM: The Electronic Medical Records Module

A custom-built, therapist-centered, HIPAA-compliant platform that functions not just as an EMR — but as an intelligent practice partner.

🛠️ Core Features:

Encrypted Session Notes (SOAP, DAP, narrative)

Treatment Planning tools

Client Management with role-based access (Therapist, Supervisor, Admin)

Appointment Scheduling with conflict detection + client history

Automated Communication Hub:

Reminders

Follow-ups

Onboarding sequences

Audit-Ready Compliance Logging

Analytics Dashboards for clinicians and supervisors

Future-Ready Architecture:

Therapist-scoped encryption keys

Integration-ready with insurance billing, client portal, and clinical AI

Tech Stack:
React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL (Neon), Tailwind CSS, AES-256-GCM encryption, JWT auth, Resend email service

🌐 2. Refactored Public Website

A modern, client-friendly website that communicates the MindFit brand and smoothly transitions visitors into the EMRM onboarding funnel.

🎨 Features:

Home Page: Welcoming, clear CTA (“Schedule Appointment”)

Services Page: Individual therapy, OCD consults, groups, behavior plans

About Page: Team bios, FAQ, values

Contact Page: Appointment request form with Resend email integration

Client Portal Link: Seamless redirect to secure EMRM login

Newsletter Signup: Mailchimp or Google Form

Modern Design: Tailwind CSS + React-based layout for speed and mobile responsiveness

Hosted on:
Replit (with custom domain), connected to EMRM backend for secure form routing

🔄 The Integration Strategy

Website is public-facing (SEO, client-facing info)

EMRM is protected, encrypted, and used internally by therapists + clients

Both systems are branded consistently and linked via client portal access

🧩 Why It Matters

This project gives MindFit:

Full control over clinical workflows and client data

A HIPAA-compliant system designed for therapists, not hospitals

An engaging, mobile-first digital presence for new clients

Scalable infrastructure for growth (more therapists, locations, or services)

A foundation to layer in telehealth, client self-service, and clinical intelligence
